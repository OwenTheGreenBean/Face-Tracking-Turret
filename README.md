# Face-Tracking-Turret
A project I made with the goal of a face tracking module. The turret is 3D printed and controlled with two servos, face detection is processed on my laptop camera and coordinates are sent to an Arduino to communicate points.  YouTube video: https://studio.youtube.com/video/a_UiYOO-Sdw/edit
